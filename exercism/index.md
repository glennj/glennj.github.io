# Exercism

Exercism is [exercism.org][exercism], a place to learn new programming languages through TDD practice exercises.

## Journey

Some thoughts about my exercism journey ...

* I can pinpoint the first time I ever heard about exercism: [this Stackoverflow bash question][so-bash-bats].
* My first exercise submission was about 3 hours afterward: [Hello World on the bash track][ex-bash-hw].
* My first PR was about 7 months later: [porting the `all-your-base` exercise for bash][gh-ex-pr1].

## #12in23

The [#12in23] challenge: get started with 12 new languages in 2023. What shall I do?

* Python: I've mostly finished this track, but pick up some of the un-addressed ones.
* Powershell: can't know too many shells ;)
    * kind of cheating that it's not active and only maintainers can see it.
* Haskell: now that I have elixir and common-lisp under my belt, look at this "pure" functional language.

This challenge is extra motivation to get [the `jq` track][gh-ex-jq] shipped!

## My exercises

My exercises are [stored in git][gh-glennj-ex].
This repo includes my mentor notes.

## Exercism CLI tool

I have to link to my [fish wrapper around `exercism` CLI][fish-wrapper].
